# Pong
This is a 2 Player Pong game made with C++ and Raylib. <br>
The Project is **not** Optimized and was made **just** for the learning C++ and Raylib without a Tutorial, so dont expect perfect code :)

#### Overview
1. Game Overview
2. How to play
3. How to build local
4. What to do



## Main Game
#### Here the beautiful Gameplay ._. <br>

## How to play
Player Inputs are: <br>
 **W** and **S** for the first Player and<br>
 **I** and **K** for the second Player


## How to build
There currently isnt any Cmake or Make file, since i still have to get in to that, so here is just the Debug way :/
#### Linux
1. Use the build in  existing Bash file by generating an Output file wiht _"bash build.bash"_ <br>
1.2 Or direkt the Command _"g++ -g main.cpp Player.cpp Ball.cpp Punktestand.cpp -o main -lraylib -lm -ldl -lpthread -lGL -lX11"_ 
2. Then execute the generated file with ./main


#### Windows
- Have not tested it yet, but should be the same or minimal differend (sry)

#### Mac
- no clue either (sry)

## What to do (with the code and game now)
I guess play and have fun... **BUT**

| What TO do  | What NOT to do |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Play the game      | Use the code for learning     |
| Improve the Code and learn      | uhhh   |
| Leave advice      |  well...    |
